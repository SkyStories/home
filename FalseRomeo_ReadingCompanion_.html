False Romeo&mdash;the failed lover who tries to impress and ends up with nothing&mdash;begins with our &ldquo;hero,&rdquo; Yuuto Ishikawa. A mediocre student and rather terrible in the relationship department, the 15-year-old Yuuto is forced into an unfamiliar high school after moving for the first time in his life to a city that he&rsquo;s barely visited before. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never having been a &ldquo;people person,&rdquo; as he calls it, Yuuto finds himself in a bind at the school. Almost nobody talks to him (though that doesn&rsquo;t bother him too much), few people pay him any attention and nobody expects anything of him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a week into the school year, a new transfer student joins his class, and introduces herself to him&mdash;as his fianc&eacute;e, that is. Hanae Tsukuda, a girl Yuuto is completely unfamiliar with&hellip;or perhaps not? But the story wouldn&rsquo;t be interesting if it ended there! Yuuto seems to also catch the eye of another girl in his class: Sayaka Hamasaki, the class representative for Yuuto&rsquo;s class 1-C.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determined to make a change, Yuuto makes himself a promise and strives to force himself out of his comfort zone and become more socially accepted. That is where our story begins! Enter our False Romeo, side by side with us, trapped in this play, and a dance of eternal solitude&hellip;or so he thinks. Heaven knows, maybe there&rsquo;s someone else waiting for him out there! </span></p><p class="c1 c23"><span class="c28 c21"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c36 c24">Format</span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c2">This story is written in chapters, separated by the chapter number (in roman numerals, &lsquo;cause why not?). </span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c9">Yuuto quotes literature once in a while. These quotes are fully written in italics, but are also between quotation marks (&ldquo;</span><span class="c9 c26">texttexttext texttexttext texttexttext</span><span class="c2">&rdquo;). You can probably guess what he&rsquo;s quoting though.</span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c9">Texts (on the phone) are done with single quotation marks (&lsquo;texttexttext texttexttext texttexttext&rsquo;). They are also much less formal than normal conversation, as they are directly quoting the text. Regular conversation is done&hellip;well&hellip;regularly (&ldquo;texttexttext texttexttext texttexttext&rdquo;). Thoughts are done without quotation marks in italics (</span><span class="c9 c26">texttexttext texttexttext texttexttext</span><span class="c2">). Quotations within text, such as saying something while using air quotes in real life, are done with single marks within quotation marks (&ldquo;texttexttext &lsquo;texttexttext&rsquo; texttexttext&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="c1 c23 c17"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c24 c36">Characters</span></p><p class="c1 c23"><span class="c21 c28"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Note: To see spoilers, simply highlight them with your mouse (click and drag)! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25">Main Characters</span></p><a id="t.0bd07b02a6688ad27742976be35d1c133844ba13"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c4"><tbody><tr class="c33"><td class="c16" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c0">Character</span></p></td><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c0">Brief Biography</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c6"><td class="c16" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Yuuto Ishikawa</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">(Male, Age 15)</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Birthday:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;August 17</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Height: </span><span class="c2">178cm</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Weight:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;74.8kg</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Hair:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Black</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Eyes:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Brown</span></p></td><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-proclaimed &ldquo;False Romeo,&rdquo; Yuuto falls into a whole other category of failure when it comes to relationships.

Despite that, however, Yuuto puts up with her constantly, causing her to slowly grow affectionate towards him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite cold until you get to know her, Sayaka seems to have a habit of analysing every single one of her classmates.
