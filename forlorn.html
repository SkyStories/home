				Is love real? Well, if you ask me, the answer is "it depends," but still. I present to you what I'd like to
				consider one of (if not the most) ambitious sort of project I've tried to pursue in quite some time. Written
				in <b>first person</b> (yes, I know, what a shocker!) this story recounts the lives of a rather <i>essentric</i>
				cast living in the fictional city of Seishun (in the Kyoto prefecture), where spirits are commonplace and life
				is anything but pleaceful and simple. This is a story about hope and about heartbreak. It seeks to rattle
				the inner workings of the mind as the reader watches the events unfold before their very eyes. Will all be
				well, or will it all turn to ash and dust? This story is rated 18+ for adult content/humour, violence and gore, 
				coarse language and mature subject matter. Reader discretion is highly advised. Furthermore, please be warned
				that the chapters containing adult material are not outlined (unlike before) because you'd need the other parts
				of the story given in those chapters to understand the rest. It's not extreme 18+ material, I swear, but be ready...mentally.
