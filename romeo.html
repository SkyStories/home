				Maybe you watch too much anime. Maybe you like rom-coms. Maybe you just want to read a borderline light novel for free. Whatever your motivations may be, False Romeo is a story about Yuuto Ishikawa and his (complete lack of) luck with both life in general as well as the one thing that teenage boys seem to spend a <i>little</i> too much time thinking about: getting girls. 
				Please see a copy off the reading companion of you're ever confused about the story. However, beware: these reading companions are sometimes disasters waiting to happen in terms of spoilers, and very few as censored like the one you see with this story.
