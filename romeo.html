				Maybe you watch too much anime. Maybe you like rom-coms. Maybe you just want to read a borderline light novel for free. Whatever your motivations may be, False Romeo is a story about Yuuto Ishikawa and his (complete lack of) luck with both life in general as well as the one thing that teenage boys seem to spend a <i>little</i> too much time thinking about: getting girls. 
				Please see a copy of the reading companion of you're ever confused about the story. However, beware: these reading companions are sometimes disasters waiting to happen in terms of spoilers, and very few as censored like the one you see with this story.
				This story is rated 16+ for mild adult content/humour, coarse language and mature subject matter. Reader discretion is advised.
