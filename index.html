				<h1>Quick Update</h1>
				<p>2019-09-05</p>
				<p>Quick update for the site! We had a little change at the suggestion of some contributors. In short, there are now longer works and shorter works placed on separate pages (click on "Start Reading" and you'll see what I mean). One short story has also been uploaded. We're currently reviewing some chapters, but expect a total of about 30 new chapters to be released between my two ongoing works in the near future. No promises when, though!</p>

				<h1>10 New Chapters</h1>
				<p>2019-05-29</p>
				<p>Forlorn Affairs is now at 20 chapters! We have some new developments, but everything's going great. I've gotten someone to look it over too so (hopefully) we'll have fewer typos. I don't think they were <i>that</i> prominent to begin with, but still. I was going to upload up to chapter 22, but I figured y'all could do with some suspense. Oh, and Md, if you're reading this (you know who you are) have fun. Just...uhh...don't question my...err...<i>greatness</i> (jkjk I'm not <i>that</i> arrogant).</p>

				<h2>Big Oof — The 50 Chapter Spree</h2>
				<p>2019-04-21</p>
				<p>This one took a little while, but I've updated one of my projects to 60 chapters! Furthermore, I'll be uploading the first few chapters of my newest project (I work on 2 at once) in a little bit (later today).</p>

				<h2>Second Upload Spree — 10 Chapters!</h2>
				<p>2019-03-03</p>
				<p>I found some time between work today, so I went ahead and uploaded the first 10 chapters of my current work. The whole story is actually quite far in at the moment but a lot of it is undergoing revision and I simply don't have the time to upload it all at once, so you're all gonna have to wait a little longer!</p>

			<article id="3" class="invisible">
				<h2>Mass Upload Spree</h2>
				<p>2019-01-21</p>
				<p>After a certain amount of time working (thanks to school and all), I went ahead and uploaded as much as possible all in one go. Enjoy!</p>
			</article>
			<article id="2" class="invisible">
				<h2>Uploads Begin!</h2>
				<p>2018-12-17</p>
				<p>The first upload comes online today! Party time!</p>
