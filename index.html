				<h2>Big Oof — The 50 Chapter Spree</h2>
				<p>2019-04-21</p>
				<p>This one took a little while, but I've updated one of my projects to 60 chapters! Furthermore, I'll be uploading the first few chapters of my newest project (I work on 2 at once) in a little bit (later today).</p>

				<h2>Second Upload Spree — 10 Chapters!</h2>
				<p>2019-03-03</p>
				<p>I found some time between work today, so I went ahead and uploaded the first 10 chapters of my current work. The whole story is actually quite far in at the moment but a lot of it is undergoing revision and I simply don't have the time to upload it all at once, so you're all gonna have to wait a little longer!</p>

				<h2>Mass Upload Spree</h2>
				<p>2019-01-21</p>
