				<a href="longs.html">Longer Stories</a>
				<p>These stories tend to be longer, as you might have guessed. In other words, they last more than 10,000 words and have chapters. Consider them each a "series," if you will. Hope you enjoy.</p>

				<a href="shorts.html">Short Stories</a>
				<p>These are obviously shorter stories with no chapters (A.K.A "one-shots"). They're under 10,000 words for a quick read. These are not the things that I usually work on, but on occasion a good one may pop up and I'll upload it.</p>
