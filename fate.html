				Ever imagined yourself in a semi-futuristic, not-so-steampunk styled world where man and machine walk side 
				by side? Ever imagine man being made <i>into</i> machine? No? Well, crap. Here you go anyways. Please see
				a copy of the reading companion of you're ever confused about the story. However, beware: these reading 
				companions are sometimes disasters waiting to happen in terms of spoilers. This story is rated 18+ for 
				adult content/humour, coarse language and mature subject matter. Reader discretion is highly advised.
